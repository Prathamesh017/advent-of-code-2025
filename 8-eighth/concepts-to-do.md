Phase 1 — Distance & global comparison (geometry basics)
Concepts

Euclidean distance (2D, then 3D)

Pairwise comparison

Global minimum vs local minimum

Problems

Closest Pair of Points (Brute Force)

Practice finding minimum distance

Any platform, small N

K Closest Points to Origin

LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

Phase 2 — Connectivity (no geometry yet)
Concepts

Graph as nodes + edges

Connected components

Transitive connectivity

Problems

Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/

Number of Provinces

LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/

Redundant Connection

LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/

Phase 3 — Greedy edge selection (core intuition)
Concepts

Greedy choice

Skip edges that don’t change connectivity

Edge ordering matters

Problems

Minimum Spanning Tree (Conceptual)

Read + understand, no coding yet

Kruskal’s Algorithm (simple graphs)

GeeksForGeeks explanation + example

Phase 4 — Union Find / DSU (tool, not theory)
Concepts

find() → which group am I in

union() → merge groups

Path compression

Why DSU replaces manual grouping

Problems

Disjoint Set Union – Basics

CSES: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1676/

Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph (DSU)

GeeksForGeeks

Number of Operations to Make Network Connected

LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/

Phase 5 — Geometry + Graphs (where your problem lives)
Concepts

Points → distances → edges

Geometry as edge weight

MST on spatial points

Problems

Min Cost to Connect All Points

LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/

Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (small N)

SPOJ / CSES variants

Phase 6 — Variations & intuition builders (advanced but optional)
Concepts

Partial MST

Stop after K merges

Track last merge edge

Component size aggregation

Problems

Partial MST (custom practice)

Stop after K edges, report components

Clustering using MST

Conceptual / blog problems

How to use this list (important)

Do NOT rush

One problem per phase is enough

If a phase feels unclear → stay there

Come back to your original problem after Phase 4

At that point, it will feel familiar, not scary.
